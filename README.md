# Employee Attrition Prediction (End-to-End ML Project)

## Overview
This project predicts employee attrition using machine learning and provides
actionable HR insights. A Logistic Regression model was selected for its strong
performance (ROC-AUC = 0.807) and high interpretability.

The project covers the complete ML lifecycle:
EDA → Preprocessing → Modeling → Explainability → Deployment.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis with business insights
- Multiple ML models with proper evaluation
- Interpretable Logistic Regression model
- Streamlit web application for real-time predictions
- Fully deployable and reproducible pipeline

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## Live Demo
🚀 *Add Streamlit link here after deployment*

## How to Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
